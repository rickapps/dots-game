1) Create array using divs. Boxes should not rearrange when screen is resized. Be nice if Boxes
would resize with screen size. 
2) Use flex to create the array dynamically.
3) Use CSS to change the style of the divs.
4) Use transforms and keyframes to animate the grid.

New approach:
Make the game a fixed size. Use transforms to grow and shrink game board 
as needed.
Second Try - Added a slider and use javascript to change height and width of div square.
The dots in the square resize because diameter is set to a percent of square width. Problem -
the percentage needs to change depending on the number of dots in the square.
We will set three game sizes: easy 5x5, medium 8x8, expert 10x10.
Easy: 20%, Medium: 12.5%, Expert: 10%

Typical resolution on mobile phone is 360 X 740 but there is lots of variation.
Typical resolution for tablet is 768 X 1024 
Desktop might be 1920 X 1080

Three types of Divs - Claim, Line, and Dot. These are placed in three layers, Bottom, Middle, Top.
Top overlaps all other layers.  5x5 dots has 4x4 claims, 4x5 horizontals, 4x5 verticals

POST gameboard to server and the current move. Server responds with updated gameboard and an
array of moves. Javascript processes the array in order. It waits for animations to complete 
before starting the next move.

1) Drop down to load different style sheets
2) Create Layout for a box corner
3) Create transitions for a box corner
4) Javascript to fire a transitions
5) Post request to server
6) Javascript function to process array of transistions
7) How to serialize gameboard class. Can same class be used for Javascript? Gameboard class uses
box numbers and sides instead of dots and lines.

1) Create main screen layout that keeps one section square shaped base on vmin.
2) Create divs for scoreboard, options, help, and navigation. See if all can fit on main screen.
